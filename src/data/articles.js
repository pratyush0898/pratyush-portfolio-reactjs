					<p>Hey there! My name is Pratyush, and I'm a 14-year-old coder with a big dream: to be the CEO of a $100 million company by the time I'm 30. That might sound crazy, but I believe anyone can achieve amazing things if they start early and never stop learning.</p>
					<p>Right now, I'm in seventh grade, tackling subjects like science, math, and English (all in English!). But my real passion is coding. I love building things with languages like React, JavaScript, and Python. I'm even working on learning Spanish on the side — gotta stay curious, right?</p>
					<h2>The Challenges and Rewards of Coding</h2>
					<p>Sure, there are times when coding can be tough. Sometimes things don't work the way I want them to, and it's easy to get discouraged. But that's when I remember why I started: the thrill of creating something new, the satisfaction of solving a problem with code.</p>
					<p>Here's the thing: you don't need to be a genius to code. You just need the drive to learn and the willingness to keep trying. The internet is full of amazing resources — free courses, tutorials, online communities — that can teach you everything you need to know.</p>
					<h2>Why You Should Start Coding</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Problem-solving superpower:</strong> Coding teaches you how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps. This skill is useful not only in coding but in every aspect of life.</li>
						<li><strong>The future is coded:</strong> The world is becoming increasingly reliant on technology. Whether you want to be a doctor, a lawyer, or an artist, understanding code will give you a massive advantage.</li>
						<li><strong>Build something awesome:</strong> Coding lets you turn your ideas into reality. Imagine creating your own game, website, or app — the possibilities are endless!</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>My Tips for Aspiring Coders</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Start small:</strong> Don't try to build a Facebook clone on day one. Begin with simple projects and gradually increase the complexity as you learn.</li>
						<li><strong>Find a community:</strong> Join online forums or coding groups to connect with other coders. You can share your work, get help when you're stuck, and be inspired by others.</li>
						<li><strong>Most importantly, have fun!</strong> Coding should be enjoyable. If you're not having fun, take a break, come back later, and try a different approach.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Remember, becoming a CEO, or anything you set your mind to, takes time and dedication. So, what are you waiting for? Open up a coding platform, start with a simple project, and see where the journey takes you. The world of code is waiting to be explored!</p>
					<h2>The Final Word</h2>
					<p>The world of coding is vast and ever-evolving, but it's also a world that welcomes anyone with a curious mind and a willingness to learn. So, whether you're a seasoned programmer or a complete beginner, there's always something new to discover. Keep coding, keep learning, and keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be the next tech giant, or maybe you'll use your coding skills to solve a problem that changes the world. The only limit is your imagination!</p>
					<p><strong>Check out what others are creating!</strong></p>
					<p>While my website (pratyush.io) might be under construction, there are many amazing coders out there sharing their work online. Explore coding communities, websites, and apps to see what inspires you. Happy coding!</p>
